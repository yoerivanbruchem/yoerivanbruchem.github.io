My name is Yoeri van Bruchem.  Several years ago I began working in data engineering, data analytics, and data visualization. Now, I am learning to become a data scientist in order to be able to generate even more value from data. 
For the last couple of years, I have been working (as a consultant from Ordina) at various companies like ABN AMRO Mortgages, ABN AMRO Private Banking, and NDW (former part of Dutch Rijkswaterstaat). During these assignments, I learned how to collect, transform and analyze data in order to provide meaningful insights and help to make better decisions. 

In five years, I see myself as a better professional and an expert on data science and data engineering. I am open-minded, eager to learn and, in a world that's changing rapidly, I know that I can use data and insights to make a big difference. It's my dream to not only contribute to commercial problems but also work on more important subjects like climate change, healthcare, and human well-being.  

I know that I am a team player, trustworthy, and always open to challenges and constructive feedback. I am also creative and eager to find (the most simple) solutions for the most complex problems. 

Personally, I am passionate about mountain biking, nature walks, reading, and doing some construction work on my house.
